Bomber Man!

Welcome to my project: Bomber man. 
I recreated this game that was created in 1983 and made my own version of it. The original game is an action/puzzle type that was created by one of the most important franchises in the world of video games.

My version of the game is quite small. The user will place a bomb in the row and column. The bomb will explode and will show the new value of the numbers, if there are only 0s, you have won.

During the making of the game I have faced many challenges as I'm new to coding and had to redo parts of the coding of the project. What helped me go through these challenges was that I've re-watched the information of the courses and also used online help.

In the game you will go through the next parts:

1. You will be asked to pick a number between 2 and 10 to create the size of the matrix
2. The matrix will be shown
3. The menu will be shown where you have the options to: Put the bomb, See the matrix, or leave
4. In the menu option: Put the bomb, there will be asked in which row and column you want to put the bomb and the bomb will explode. If the matrix only shows 0s, you have won and the game ends.
5. In the menu option: See the matrix, you will see the matrix again.
6. In the menu option: Leave, the game will shut down
